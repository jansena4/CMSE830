This Repository is for the CMSE 830 Midterm Project.

This project hopes to explore the relationships between physical activity levels, general health measures, and sleep patterns.

There are several ideas for what to check:
- The relationship between ages, their bedtime and wake-up time, and the overall sleep quality. This would be interesting to explore the stereotype that teenagers and young adults go to bed later than adults and therefore get worse sleep.
- The relationships between physical activity levels, sleep, and overall health. Potentially comparing measures of general health against physical activity measure and sleep duration/quality to determine which measure is more predictive of health levels.
- General trends among these factors (age, gender, bmi level, etc.) and activity level. This would be an interesting way to see whetehr the stereotype of "gym bros" working out more/being healthier than the general population seems to be true.
